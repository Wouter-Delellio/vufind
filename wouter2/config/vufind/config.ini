; url can also be an array of servers. If so, VuFind will try the servers one by one
; until one can be reached. This is only useful for advanced fault-tolerant Solr
; installations.

; Default bibliographic record core
default_core    = wouter2_core
; Default authority record core
default_authority_core = authority
; This setting needs to match the <maxBooleanClauses> setting in your solrconfig.xml
; file; when VuFind has to look up large numbers of records using ID values, it may
; have to restrict the size of its result set based on this limitation.
maxBooleanClauses = 1024
; This is the timeout in seconds when communicating with the Solr server.
timeout = 30
; This is the Dismax handler to use if nothing is specified in searchspecs.yaml.
; You can choose dismax for standard Dismax (the default) or edismax for Extended
; Dismax, or you can configure your own custom handler in solrconfig.xml.
default_dismax_handler = dismax
; This is the number of records to retrieve in a batch e.g. when building a record
; hierarchy. A higher number results in fewer round-trips but may increase Solr's
; memory usage. Default is 1000. Set to false to disable use of cursors in retrieval
; (which is only necessary if your local custom code leverages Solr features which
; are incompatible with cursorMark usage).
;cursor_batch_size = 1000
; This limits the number of records to retrieve in a batch e.g. when retrieving
; records for a list. Default is 100 which should be a good number to avoid
; memory problems.
;record_batch_size = 100

; Enable/Disable searching reserves using the "reserves" Solr core.  When enabling
; this feature, you need to run the util/index_reserves.php script to populate the
; new index.

; This is the default theme for non-mobile devices (or all devices if mobile_theme
; is disabled below). Available standard themes:
;   bootstrap3 = HTML5 theme using Bootstrap 3 + jQuery libraries, with minimal styling
;   bootprint3 = bootstrap3 theme with more attractive default styling applied
;                (named after the earlier, now-deprecated blueprint theme)
;   sandal     = bootstrap3 theme with a "flat" styling applied (a newer look
;                than bootprint3).
theme           = bootstrap3

; These settings affect your OAI server if you choose to use it.
;
; If identifier is set, its value will be used as part of the standard OAI
; identifier prefix.  It should only ever be set to a domain name that you
; control!  If it is not set, your ID values will not be prefixed.
;
; If admin_email is not set, the main email under [Site] will be used instead.
;
; page_size may be used to specify the number of records returned per request.
; Default is 100. A higher number may improve overall harvesting performance, but
; will also make a single response page larger and slower to produce.
;
; If set_field is set, the named Solr field will be used to generate sets on
; your OAI-PMH server.  If it is not set, sets will not be supported.
;
; If set_query is set (as an array mapping set names to Solr queries -- see
; examples below), the specified queries will be exposed as OAI sets.  If
; you use both set_field and set_query, be careful about the names you choose
; for your set queries. set_query names will trump set_field values when
; there are collisions.
;
; default_query may be used to specify a filter for the default set, i.e. records
; returned when a set is not specified.
;
; If vufind_api_format_fields is set, the listed fields (as defined in
; SearchApiRecordFields.yaml) are returned when metadata prefix
; "oai_vufind_json" is used.
;
; record_format_filters allows mapping from requested OAI metadataPrefix to query
; filters. They can be used e.g. to limit results to records that can be returned in
; the requested format.
;
; delete_lifetime controls how many days' worth of deleted records to include in
; responses. Records deleted before the cut-off will not be included in responses.
; Omit this setting to return all deleted records. This can be useful for long-lived
; systems with many deleted records, to prevent full harvests from becoming unwieldy.
;
; use_cursor controls whether or not to use Solr's cursor functionality for deep
; pagination of results. This defaults to true and is normally the preferred option,
; but if you custom code to apply Solr features (such as result grouping/field
; collapsing) that are incompatible with cursor-based pagination, you should turn
; the feature off here.

; This section controls which language options are available to your users.
; If you offer more than one option, a control will appear in the user
; interface to allow user selection.  If you only activate one language,
; the control will be hidden.
;
; The name of each setting below (i.e. en, de, fr) is a language code and
; corresponds with one of the translation files found in the web/lang
; directory.  The value of each setting is the on-screen name of the language,
; and will itself be subject to translation through the language files!
;
; The order of the settings is significant -- they will be displayed on screen
; in the same order they are defined here.
;
; Be sure that this section includes the default language set in the [Site]
; section above.
